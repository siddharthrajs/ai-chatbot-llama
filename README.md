# Requirements
- Latest Python version (with latest pip version)
- Latest ollama version
- Active ollama model installed (or follow instructions to instal)

Check the requirements.txt for dependencies. 

## Instructions
- install requirements manually <br/>
    `pip install <each_requirement_name>`

- run the app using streamlit <br/>
    `streamlit run app.py`

> **_NOTE:_**  If you want something simpler, there's an app2.py file. The model doesn't use embedding and is way faster. The UI is also cleaner. Run: <br/>
    `pip install langchain streamlit PyMuPDF` 
<br/>
    `streamlit run app2.py`
